Abstract

Mental illness has seriously affected people's life. Autism (ASD), Schizophrenia (SCZ) and bipolar disorder (BP) pose a significant challenge to patients’ mental well-being and remarkably reduce patient’s life expectancy. Recently large-scale exome sequencing studies of these three mental disorders reveal a strong association between the effect sizes and rare variants, especially rare protein-truncating variants (PTVs; for example, nonsense, frameshift and essential splice-site mutations). In this study, we use Fisher’s exact test to compute p-value of rare PTVs in the case-control cohort of each disorder respectively, and carry out meta-analysis to detect the association between mental disorders and rare PTVs, compared to the results of meta-analysis of three disorders using a combination of genetic mutations including rare PTVs, rare missense variants and de novo mutations. We illustrate our findings in Manhattan plots and find even though rare PTVs play a great genetic role on mental disorder, analyzing PTVs exclusively does not account for much of mental disorders compared with analysis of a combination of diverse genetic mutations.
